# KLML Supervised
Welcome to KLML Supervised, a package for supervised learning in python.

This is an ongoing project of two students in Cornell's CS-5780 Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems course.
Many of the algorithms within the package were developed for course projects. 

### Our goals for the project
 - Build a collection of useful supervised learning algorithms
 - Learning how to implement common/useful machine learning algorithms
 - Learn how and when to use each of the algorithms
 - Learn the underlying assumptions of each of the models
 - Build a functioning Python Package
